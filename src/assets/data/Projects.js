        'This project was for a tech interview to demonstrate a path finding algorithm with React for a tech interview. Requirements: (1) A map could be any size, you can pre-define it or require user input. Place random obstacles on the map. (2) Place a meeple on lower left, generate the path that will lead this char to the upper right of the map. (3) Animate the meeple walking from start to end. (4) Build your own path algorithm. (5) Use React. (6) Write a few spec tests. (7) Live site with URL. Project was completed in under 8 hours.',
